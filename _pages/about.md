About me
========
I am a senior undergraduate applied physics and computer science major at the University of Delaware.

I am interested in physics, computer science, and the many interesting aspects of this world. Currently, I am exploring the use of machine-learning in biophysics, and the application of generative large-language models to the task of code generation. I also enjoy research in high-performance computing, in areas like parallel programming and benchmarking supercomputers. 

I think that the explosion of technology is underutilized in many domains of science, and that the integration of software engineering with scientific discovery will lead to many developments in society.

I hope to contribute of this technological scientific advancement through my research, from personal projects to group projects within academia, and through a PhD program. 

Please feel free to reach out to me to chat about the universe, to collaborate on projects, or anything else.
